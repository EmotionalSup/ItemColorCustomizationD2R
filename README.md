Above is the most relevant video on modding D2R. It shows how to use a mod folder to only load the modified Diablo 2 Resurrected files, instead of having to extract all 40GB of data. This uses the `-mod {modname} -txt` command to load modified files from the `mods/{modname}/{modname}.mpq` directory. It is the easiest and fastest way to use Diablo 2 Resurrected mods.

This video is outdated, and you should instead use the video above about the fastest way to mod Diablo 2 Resurrected. This guide went over using MPQ files to package and load the D2R mod, but this still relied on generating .bin files, which meant that `-direct -txt` still needed to be used. As a result, you needed to have the full data directory (40GB) extracted.
